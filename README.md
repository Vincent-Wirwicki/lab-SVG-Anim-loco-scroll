# lab-svgAnim-loco-scroll

An experimental project about using SVG and animate them with css.  
I also try [locomotive scroll](https://github.com/locomotivemtl/locomotive-scroll) for smooth scroll and some parallax effect.  

[Demo](https://lab-mysvg-loco.herokuapp.com/)

Svg on this image was made with Illustrator

##SVG propreties

In this project i mostly used :
- [circle](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/SVG/Element/circle) shape
- [Path](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Paths) i also used [this](https://codepen.io/jakob-e/pen/bgBegJ) to transform a circle to a path
- [dash-stroke](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/s/stroke-dasharray/) and [dash-stroke-offset](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/s/stroke-dashoffset/) 
For animation i experiment with cubic bezier(https://youtube.com/shorts/BThr1pb77Fo?feature=share) and used value from here(https://easings.net/fr)

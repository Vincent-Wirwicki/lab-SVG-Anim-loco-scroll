# lab-svgAnim-loco-scroll

An experimental project about using SVG and animate them with css.  
I also try [locomotive scroll](https://github.com/locomotivemtl/locomotive-scroll) for smooth scroll and some parallax effect.  

[Demo](https://lab-mysvg-loco.herokuapp.com/)

Svg on this image was made with Illustrator

## SVG propreties

In this project i mostly used :
- [Circle](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/SVG/Element/circle) shape
- [Path](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Paths) i also used [this](https://codepen.io/jakob-e/pen/bgBegJ) to transform a circle to a path
- [Dash-stroke](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/s/stroke-dasharray/) and [dash-stroke-offset](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/s/stroke-dashoffset/) 
- I also imported a more complexe SVG shape made with adobe illustrator (the one on picture project)


## Locomotive scroll
It's an easy tool to use, to make smooth scrolling experience and parallax effect. I used this [tutorial](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/scrolling-website-with-locomotive-scroll-tailwind-css--cms-36943)

## Animation
For animation it's pure css.   
I experiment with [cubic bezier](https://youtube.com/shorts/BThr1pb77Fo?feature=share) and used value from [here](https://easings.net/fr)
